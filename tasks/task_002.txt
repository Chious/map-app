# Title: Implement TDX API integration service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service to interact with the TDX API for public transportation data
# Details:
Implement a service layer that handles authentication with TDX API. Create modules for fetching different types of data: bus routes, train schedules, and Ubike availability. Implement rate limiting to respect API constraints. Create data models that match the TDX API response structure. Document all API endpoints being used.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the API service. Create mock responses for testing. Verify successful authentication and data retrieval from TDX API endpoints.
