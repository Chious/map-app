# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement transport route visualization on map
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create visualization layers for bus routes, train lines, and stations on the map
# Details:
Create DeckGL layers for different transportation types: bus routes (PathLayer), train lines (PathLayer), stations/stops (ScatterplotLayer). Implement proper styling and colors for each transportation type. Add interactive features like hover and click. Implement layer toggling. Optimize rendering for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test layer rendering with different data sets. Verify interactive features work correctly. Measure rendering performance with large data sets.
