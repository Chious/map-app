# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement data caching system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a caching system for TDX data with appropriate refresh intervals
# Details:
Implement a caching service that stores TDX data in the database. Follow the specified refresh intervals: bus data every 30 seconds, train schedules daily, and Ubike data every 5 minutes. Create background jobs for data refresh. Implement cache invalidation strategies. Add timestamp tracking for data freshness. Handle cache misses gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Test cache hit/miss scenarios. Verify that data is refreshed according to the specified intervals. Measure cache performance under load.
