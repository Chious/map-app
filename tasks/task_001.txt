# Description: Initialize the project repository with React + Vite frontend and Express backend structure
# Details:
Create a monorepo structure with separate directories for frontend and backend. Initialize the frontend with Vite and React, configure TailwindCSS. Set up the Express backend with TypeScript support. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Git hooks for code quality. Create basic README documentation with setup instructions.
